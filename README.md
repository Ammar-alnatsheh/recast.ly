This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

# React is Interesting in a Few Key Ways
React uses JSX, which is a syntax extension to JS that is used to describe what the UI should look like.
React offers two types of view components, a simple functional-style component, and a feature rich class-based component.
When using React, developers don't have to listen to changes and manually trigger a re-render - instead, React will re-render the necessary components upon state change.

Learn how to transpile code with Babel's command line tool
Practice using ES6 features
Continue practicing interactions with a REST API (in this case, the YouTube Data API)
